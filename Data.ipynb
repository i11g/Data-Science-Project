    "## Abstract \n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores the feasibility of forecasting global university rankings at the country level using macroeconomic and educational indicators. Drawing on data from the QS World University Rankings (2017–2022) and country-level variables such as GDP per capita, literacy rate, and R&D expenditure, the analysis aims to predict each country’s average university rank in 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, we apply and compare a set of forecasting methods, including:\n",
    "- Linear Trend Extrapolation\n",
    "- Multivariate Monte Carlo Simulation\n",
    "- Prophet with Regressors\n",
    "- ARIMA with Exogenous Variables (ARIMAX)\n",
    "- Baseline models (Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each model offers a different perspective—some prioritize time dynamics, while others emphasize economic context and uncertainty. Forecasts are validated using actual 2024 QS rankings where available. The results highlight both the predictive power of national-level indicators and the strengths and weaknesses of each forecasting technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "This work provides a data-driven framework for understanding the evolution of educational performance across countries and suggests how policymakers and academic stakeholders might respond to long-term trends in global rankings. "

    "## Introduction \n",
    "The QS World University Rankings provide an annual benchmark for academic performance globally. Forecasting university rankings at the country level can help identify macroeconomic and policy factors that drive academic excellence and anticipate future shifts in global education.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use four forecasting models to estimate the average country-level QS university ranking for 2024. Each model is based on different mathematical principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linear Trend Extrapolation\n",
    "We fit a linear regression model to each country’s historical average rank over time:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each model captures different assumptions: trend continuity (linear), economic impact (Monte Carlo), recent stability (MA), or momentum (smoothing). These approaches are compared quantitatively and visually in later sections."

    "## Objective\n",
    "This project investigates whether global university rankings at the country level can be forecasted using key economic and educational indicators. Specifically, it aims to predict the average QS World University Rank per country for the year 2024 based on historical data (2017–2022) and variables such as GDP per capita, literacy rate, and R&D expenditure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivation\n",
    "University rankings play a critical role in shaping international education policy, research funding, and student decision-making. While many analyses focus on institutional performance, this project shifts the lens to the country level, offering insights into how macroeconomic and social conditions influence national academic outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "To what extent do indicators like GDP per capita, literacy rate, and R&D investment correlate with average university rank?\n",
    "\n",
    "Can time series and regression-based models accurately forecast future rankings using this data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Which forecasting methods provide the most reliable and interpretable predictions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Significance\n",
    "The ability to anticipate changes in a country's academic standing can inform education policy, international collaboration, and investment decisions. It also helps identify which countries are likely to improve or decline in global academic competitiveness — and why. "
